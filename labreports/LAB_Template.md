## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1 | Score 1 | Summary 1 |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps. 

Step 1
![Step 1](/assets/Site1pt1.PNG)
I liked how the site could use my gmail account to speed up the profile creation step.  

Step 2
![Step 2](/assets/Site1pt2.PNG) 
I liked how the site had an feature that would show you a list of jobs similar to the one you were typing. 

Step 3
![Step 3](/assets/Site1pt3.PNG) 
I liked how you could set each of these features. I would change this section to clearly state what each of the options do. I assume the not looking but open limits the ammount of emails the site will send, but I am not completly sure.

Step 4
![Step 4](/assets/Site1pt4.PNG)  
I loved this feature of the sign up process. It will help th site select jobs based off of prefernce. Many sites I have seen lack this refinement step for their search algorithms.

Step 5 <br>
This image is missing because it was a resume upload button. As soon as the site accepts the resume it moves on. There were also some boxes you could fill out if you did not have a resume. I disliked that the site would move on if it accepted a resume. I would change this to a complete button, in case the user uploads the wrong document by accident. 

Step 6
![Step 6](/assets/Site1pt6.PNG) 
Nothing to say about this page. I would remove it because it does not add anything to the process.

Step 7
![Step 7](/assets/Site1pt7.PNG)  
This page was intuitive to use and I have seen this functionality on pretty much every job site.

Step 8
![Step 8](/assets/Site1pt8.PNG)  
This is the profile page so the user can edit their profile. This site didn't have anything super unique here, but I was able to find everything I could want to add or change.

Step 9
![Step 9](/assets/Site1pt9.PNG)  
I liked how there was a description box so a user could fill in extra releveant information if they wanted too.

Step 10
![Step 10](/assets/Site1pt10.PNG)  
This step is almost identitcle to how Linkedin handles users adding skills. A user can then certify their skills if they want.

Step 11
![Step 11](/assets/Site1pt11.PNG)  
There is a more inoformation at the bottom of the profile page for when a user has a lot of experiance and expectations thay can add it. 

Step 12
![Step 12](/assets/Site1pt12.PNG) 
A user can add a phone number. 

Step 13
![Step 13](/assets/Site1pt13.PNG)  
A user can add a location. I liked how there was an option to see jobs that could be remote or require a user to relocate.

Step 14
![Step 14](/assets/Site1pt14.PNG)  
A user can add refences to their profile

Step 15
![Step 15](/assets/Site1pt15.PNG)  
Here is where the job results appear. I like how they are spaced out in boxes. This makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the information clearly tied to a specific job.

Step 16
![Step 16](/assets/Site1pt16.PNG)  
There is a one click apply for jobs on this site. I did not see an option for a lengthier application. I would change this as a 1-click apply is convenient, but does not allow users to see what specific information is being sent to the company.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  |  The site was very easy to use. At no point in the process of signing up or applying for a job was I confused or unsure of what to do. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | There were a lot of steps and a few pages that I feel should have been condensed or removed.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  |  Many of the important steps were required or appeared in a checkbox on the right side of the profile page. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | This site allows companies to post jobs for free. I did not  see one company appearing an unusual ammount of times. I have only used the site for this project so I cannot say for sure, but I believe the site is not trying to push people into a specific path.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 |  The site had a few things I would not have added. Overall it was not overly wordy. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  The site was easy to navigate. The site had good guidence for registering and updating profiles.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2.7 |  The site usupports the standard mouse-less interface keys. I cannot say if it is worse or better than normal, but I was able to navigate around and preforn the same actions. I was also able to navigate the site with a screen reader but ran into several problems where key information was not read when I felt it should have been. This might have been a problem with my screen reader as I am not used to using screen readers. |
| **TOTAL** |  17.7 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

Step 1
![Step 1](/assets/Site2pt1.PNG)  
It was easy to find where to sign up. The ammount of pop-ups made it hard to look at and fought for my attention. This immeditly made me want to leave the site. I would remove the pop-ups as they do not add much to the site.

Step 2
![Step 2](/assets/Site2pt2.PNG)  
I liked this page. It had everything I was expecting.

Step 3
![Step 3](/assets/Site2pt3.PNG)  
I do not understand the point of this page. I would remove this page.

Step 4
![Step 4](/assets/Site2pt4.PNG)  
This page was the same as on many other job sites. I like that it supported more file types than the others I have seen.

Step 5
![Step 5](/assets/Site2pt5.PNG) 
I disliked this page greatly. The skills section is frusterating to use. I understand why they would ask about the date last used, but you cannot remove skills in the top 5 slots. I wanted to remove C++ as I do not remember the year I used it. To do this I had to replace it with a skill below the top 5 slots and then remove that skill. This was not a huge problem, but the solution would be very simple to impliment. I would change this to have no minumum of skills or allow the user to remove any skills until there are 5 skills left.

Step 6
![Step 6](/assets/Site2pt6.PNG)  
This is the profile page. I did not like how articles showed up on this page. It felt like the user profile was not the focus of this page. The articles also fought for my attention as I was trying to find where to update different parts of my profile.

Step 7
![Step 7](/assets/Site2pt7.PNG)  
I did like how an estimated salary prediction appeared on your profile page. I also liked the career transitions and path reccomendations. 

Step 8
![Step 8](/assets/Site2pt8.PNG)  
I did not like how they added my phone number from the resume without specificly asking. I know it was probably in the terms of service, but it still feels a little annoying when personal information is not specificly asked for in a dialog box.

Step 9
![Step 9](/assets/Site2pt9.PNG)  
The process to add a skill is pretty simple.

Step 10
![Step 10](/assets/Site2pt10.PNG)  
I disliked this page because the job boxes did not display much information and there were too few of them per page. 

Step 11
![Step 11](/assets/Site2pt11.PNG)  
I liked how much information was displayed once the job was clicked on. 

Step 12
![Step 12](/assets/Site2pt12.PNG)  
I liked how you could choose what resume you used to apply for the job.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1.5  | This site was quite annoying to use as various pop-ups fought for my attention and several times I was confused as to why the site makers choosee to make the site function as it does.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  0 | While signing up was quick, I felt the primary focus of the site was making me click on articles.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  The site makes almost everything required, so everything you needed to apply was already done by the time you were allowed to apply. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1.5  |  The articles and carreer transitions lead me to believe that the site is trying to force me down a specific path. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  |  This site was not overly wordy, but there were times I wondered why some things were not ommited. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | The artiles really cluttered but the site overall and broke up the navigation and workflow.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1.5  | I could not figure out how to navigate to certain parts of the site without a mouse and my screen reader was hard to use on this site. This may be due to my lack of knowledge however.  |
| **TOTAL** | 10  |   |
